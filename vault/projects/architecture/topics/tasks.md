# Galaxy Task Management with Celery

## Learning Questions
- How does Galaxy handle long-running tasks?
- When should I use Celery?
- How do I create a new Galaxy task?

## Learning Objectives
- Understand when to use tasks vs web requests
- Learn how to declare Celery tasks
- Use Pydantic for task serialization
- Understand best practices

## Avoid Doing Work in Web Threads

Web servers are a terrible place to do work. Traditional Python WSGI servers
are meant for processing requests that take less a minute - they are meant
for long running tasks.

This request/response cycle is inappropriate for deleting all the files in a
history, submitted 10,000 batch jobs for a collection, building a zip file for
a library folder.

## Downsides of Celery

Adds more complexity to deploying Galaxy. Celery needs to be available to Galaxy
at runtime, production Galaxy instances need a broker and a backend.

## Gravity + Celery

.code[```
$ galaxy
Registered galaxy config: /home/nate/work/galaxy/config/galaxy.yml
Creating or updating service gunicorn
Creating or updating service celery
Creating or updating service celery-beat

## Declaring a Task

- Placed in `galaxy.celery.tasks`.
- We've placed a layer around Celery to mirror what we're with API endpoints.
  - Typed functions with Pydantic inputs implicitly mapped.
  - Implicit type based dependency injection from Galaxy's DI container (using Lagom)
  - Feels a lot like writing an API endpoint.

## A Simple Task

.code[```
@galaxy_task(
    ignore_result=True,
    action="setting up export history job"
)
def export_history(
    model_store_manager: ModelStoreManager,
    request: SetupHistoryExportJob,
):
    model_store_manager.setup_history_export_job(request)
```]

## The `galaxy_task` Decorator

.code[```python
@galaxy_task(
    ignore_result=True,
    action="setting up export history job"
)
def export_history(
    model_store_manager: ModelStoreManager,
    request: SetupHistoryExportJob,
):
    model_store_manager.setup_history_export_job(request)
```]

- `galaxy_task` is a wrapper around Celery's `task` decorator
- Wrap a simple function to turn it into a task.
- Ensure all inputs are JSON serializable or components in Galaxy's dependency injection container

## Celery and Pydantic

The `request` argument to `export_history` is a Pydantic model type named
`SetupHistoryExportJob`. These are mostly defined in `galaxy.schema.tasks`.

.code[```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SetupHistoryExportJob(BaseModel):
    history_id: int
    job_id: int
    store_directory: str
    include_files: bool
    include_hidden: bool
    include_deleted: bool
```]

## Celery and Pydantic - Implementation

- Custom JSON encoding and decoding to adapt Celery to Pydantic.
- Implemented in `galaxy.celery._serialization`.
- Inject `__type__` and `__class__` attributes into JSON description.
- `@galaxy_task` decorator sets Celery `serializer` attribute.

## Celery and Dependency Injection

.code[```
@galaxy_task(
    ignore_result=True,
    action="setting up export history job"
)
def export_history(
    model_store_manager: ModelStoreManager,
    request: SetupHistoryExportJob,
):
    model_store_manager.setup_history_export_job(request)
```]

- The type declaration on `model_store_manager` of `ModelStoreManager` causes
  the Galaxy manager object of this class to be passed to the function when the
  task is running.
- Client does not need to have any knowledge of this class.

## Executing Tasks from Galaxy

See `lib/galaxy/tools/imp_exp/__init__.py`:

.code[```python
from galaxy.schema.tasks import SetupHistoryExportJob

...

    request = SetupHistoryExportJob(
        history_id=history.id,
        job_id=self.job_id,
        store_directory=store_directory,
        include_files=True,
        include_hidden=include_hidden,
        include_deleted=include_deleted,
    )
    export_history.delay(request=request)

```]

The delay method is created implicitly from the `galaxy_task` decorator.

## Best Practices

- Place tasks in `galaxy.celery.tasks`.
- Keep the tasks as thin as possible (ideally simply delegate inputs
  to a manager or another Galaxy component independent of Celery).
- Ensure required/injected Galaxy components as small and decomposed as
  possible.
- Place new request definition argument types in `galaxy.schema.tasks`.

## Existing Tasks Success Stories



## PDF Export Problems

- We added PDF export of Galaxy Markdown using weasyprint
- Generation of PDF took too long, feature was quite unstable

## Short Term Storage (STS)

- A Galaxy component for managing user downloadable files that only
  need to exist for a little time.
- Traditionally, these kind of files have required a lot of
  hacking to do well in Galaxy (tracking transient request-like stuff in data model, etc..)
- Not just unoptimized by default, but unusable
- Required customizing nginx routes, special web server plugins, etc...

https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/13691

.code[```
class GeneratePdfDownload(BaseModel):
    short_term_storage_request_id: str
    basic_markdown: str
    document_type: PdfDocumentType
```]

## Robust PDF Export

.code[```python
from galaxy.managers.markdown_util import generate_branded_pdf

@galaxy_task(
    action="preparing Galaxy Markdown PDF for download"
)
def prepare_pdf_download(
    request: GeneratePdfDownload,
    config: GalaxyAppConfiguration,
    short_term_storage_monitor: ShortTermStorageMonitor,
):
    generate_branded_pdf(
        request,
        config,
        short_term_storage_monitor,
    )
```]

## Exporting Histories, Invocations, Libraries

.code[```
@galaxy_task(
    action="generate and stage a workflow invocation store for download"
)
def prepare_invocation_download(
    model_store_manager: ModelStoreManager,
    request: GenerateInvocationDownload,
):
    model_store_manager.prepare_invocation_download(
        request
    )
```]

## Optimized Uploads

- Decomposed job handling, precursor to migrating more job components to Celery
- Converting uploads to tasks signficantly sped up running Galaxy tests
  - API tests went from 2.5 hours to 50 minutes
  - Amazing speed up for small jobs
- Exploring task composition

https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/13655

## Uploads - Task Composition

See `lib/galaxy/tools/execute.py`

.code[```
async_result = (
    setup_fetch_data.s(job_id, raw_tool_source=raw_tool_source)
    | fetch_data.s(job_id=job_id).set(queue="galaxy.external")
    | set_job_metadata.s(
        extended_metadata_collection="extended" in tool.app.config.metadata_strategy,
        job_id=job_id,
    ).set(
        queue="galaxy.external",
        link_error=finish_job.si(job_id=job_id, raw_tool_source=raw_tool_source)
    )
    | finish_job.si(job_id=job_id, raw_tool_source=raw_tool_source)
)()
```]

## Batch Operations

Task-based operations enable the most expensive of the new history's batch operations.

- Changing datatypes
- Purging datasets

## Future Work

- *Migrating tool submission to tasks*
- Workflow scheduling
- Importing shared histories

https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/11721

## Key Takeaways
- Web servers are inappropriate for long-running work
- Celery handles async task execution
- Gravity manages Celery processes
- Tasks use typed functions with Pydantic
- DI works in tasks just like controllers
