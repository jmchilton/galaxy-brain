# Component: Archon (orchestration evaluation)

> Source: `https://github.com/coleam00/Archon`, cloned to `~/projects/repositories/Archon` at commit on `dev` matching CHANGELOG `0.3.10` (2026-04-29). All file paths below are relative to that clone.

## 1. What is it?

**Tagline (verbatim from `README.md` line 8):** "The first open-source harness builder for AI coding. Make AI coding deterministic and repeatable."

**Elevator pitch (`README.md` line 23):** "Archon is a workflow engine for AI coding agents. Define your development processes as YAML workflows — planning, implementation, validation, code review, PR creation — and run them reliably across all your projects." It self-positions as "Like what Dockerfiles did for infrastructure and GitHub Actions did for CI/CD … Think n8n, but for software development."

**Category.** A YAML-DAG **workflow engine that wraps coding-agent SDKs** (Claude Agent SDK, OpenAI Codex SDK, and a community Pi provider that fronts ~20 LLM backends). It is *not* a generic agent framework, *not* a multi-agent runtime, and *not* a RAG/KB system. It is closer in spirit to GitHub Actions for AI than to LangGraph or CrewAI. Platform adapters (Slack/Telegram/Discord/GitHub webhooks/Web/CLI) feed messages into a router that picks a workflow and runs it.

**Important pivot.** v1 of Archon was a Python-based "task management + RAG" multi-agent system. That codebase is archived on the `archive/v1-task-management-rag` branch and is no longer developed. The current `main`/`dev` is a complete rewrite in TypeScript/Bun (started ~Feb 2025) with a different premise. Anything written about Archon before mid-2025 is about a different product.

**Maturity / activity.**
- License: MIT (`LICENSE`).
- Stars: ~20,200; forks: ~3,090; open issues: 191.
- Last push: 2026-04-29 (the day this review was done). CHANGELOG shows roughly weekly patch releases through 0.3.x. Still pre-1.0; no compatibility promise.
- Primary maintainer: Cole Medin (coleam00) plus contributors. Bus factor appears to be roughly 1 + a small contributor pool — issues #1428–#1497 in the last ~2 weeks are mostly authored or merged by a tight group.
- Trendshift-listed; clearly still in marketing/growth phase.

**Stated goals.** Determinism and repeatability ("same workflow, same sequence, every time"), portability (workflows committed to your repo, run identically from CLI/Web/Slack/Telegram/GitHub), team-shareable processes, and isolation-by-default (every run gets its own git worktree). **Stated non-goals** (from `CLAUDE.md`): not multi-tenant, single-developer tool, KISS/YAGNI/SRP enforced explicitly. No scheduling, no general task-graph compute, no agent-to-agent negotiation.

## 2. Core architecture and primitives

Archon's vocabulary is small and concrete. The primitives are: **workflow**, **node**, **command** (prompt template), **codebase** (registered repo), **conversation**, **session**, **isolation environment** (worktree), **workflow run**, **workflow event**.

**Composition model.** Workflow-centric, not agent-centric. A workflow is a YAML DAG of nodes with `depends_on` edges. Independent nodes in the same topological layer run concurrently. The author writes the structure; the AI fills in the intelligence at each AI node.

**Node types** (from `packages/workflows/src/schemas/dag-node.ts`, mutually exclusive within a node):
- `command:` — invokes a named markdown prompt file from `.archon/commands/`.
- `prompt:` — inline prompt string, sent to the AI provider.
- `bash:` — shell script, no AI; stdout captured as `$nodeId.output`.
- `script:` — inline TS/Python (`runtime: bun | uv`) with optional `deps:` and `timeout:`; stdout captured as `$nodeId.output`.
- `loop:` — iterative AI prompt with `until:` completion-signal string, `max_iterations`, optional `fresh_context: true` (new session per iteration), `interactive: true` (pause for user via `/workflow approve`), and `until_bash:` for deterministic loop-exit checks.
- `approval:` — pure human gate. `approval.message`, optional `capture_response: true` to store the user's reply as `$node.output`, optional `on_reject:` with its own redraft prompt and `max_attempts`.
- `cancel:` — terminate the run with a reason string (think "abort branch" of a `when:` conditional).

**Per-node knobs** (also in `dagNodeBaseSchema`): `when:` JS-expression conditions, `trigger_rule:` for join semantics (`all_success | one_success | none_failed_min_one_success | all_done`), `context: fresh | shared`, `output_format:` (JSON-schema for structured output, SDK-enforced for Claude/Codex), `allowed_tools`/`denied_tools`, `hooks:` (per-node SDK hooks), `mcp:` (per-node MCP server config path), `skills:` (per-node Claude skill preload — directly relevant), `agents:` (inline Claude sub-agent definitions usable via the Task tool), `effort/thinking/maxBudgetUsd/systemPrompt/fallbackModel/betas/sandbox` (Claude SDK passthrough), `retry:` (with backoff), `idle_timeout:`, `model:`/`provider:` overrides.

**Storage / state.** SQLite by default at `~/.archon/archon.db`; PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`. 8 tables, `remote_agent_*` prefix: `codebases`, `conversations`, `sessions` (immutable, transition-linked), `messages`, `isolation_environments`, `workflow_runs` (with `working_path` for resume detection — migration `019_workflow_resume_path.sql`), `workflow_events` (step-level event log for observability), `codebase_env_vars`. Per-run artifacts live on disk under `~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/artifacts/runs/<id>/` and are reachable from inside nodes via `$ARTIFACTS_DIR`. Per-run logs go to `…/logs/`. Cross-run repo-scoped state lives at `<repo>/.archon/state/` (gitignored).

**Execution model.** Async, in-process (Bun event loop), per-run path-exclusive lock (overridable via `mutates_checkout: false`). Node concurrency is per-DAG-layer. The DAG executor lives at `packages/workflows/src/dag-executor.ts`; the loader+validator at `loader.ts`; orchestration that maps platform messages to runs at `packages/core/src/orchestrator/`.

**Multi-agent coordination.** Limited and deliberate. Archon does *not* have an agent-to-agent negotiation layer. The closest things are: (a) parallel DAG layers (the `archon-idea-to-pr` workflow runs five reviewer nodes concurrently and joins them with `trigger_rule: one_success` into a `synthesize` node — exactly the multi-reviewer fan-out you'd expect); (b) per-node `agents:` blocks that define Claude sub-agents callable via the Task tool, scoped to a single node. There's no "team of agents debating" abstraction. This is a feature, not a gap, given the determinism goal.

## 3. Tech stack and deployment

- **Languages/runtime:** TypeScript on Bun (workspaces monorepo). Strict TS. Zod schemas via `@hono/zod-openapi` (every API/engine type is OpenAPI-generated).
- **Server:** Hono (OpenAPIHono) on port 3090. SSE for streaming.
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + Zustand. Generated TypeScript types from the OpenAPI spec.
- **DB:** SQLite (default, zero-setup) or PostgreSQL.
- **Deployment options:** local Bun dev (`bun run dev`), compiled binary (Homebrew formula at `homebrew/`, install scripts at `scripts/install.{sh,ps1}`, `archon serve` to run the bundled web UI), Docker (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Caddyfile.example` for VPS), and a wizard-driven setup that's the recommended path.
- **External deps:** the chosen LLM provider's SDK (Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, or `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`); MCP servers if you use them; `gh` CLI; `git`; optional Slack/Telegram/Discord credentials; PostHog (telemetry, opt-out via `ARCHON_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`).
- **UI surfaces:** Web UI (chat, dashboard "Mission Control", drag-and-drop **Workflow Builder**, run-step viewer), CLI (`bun run cli workflow run|status|resume|abandon|cleanup`, `cli isolation list|cleanup`, `cli validate workflows|commands`), platform adapters (Slack, Telegram, Discord, GitHub webhooks).
- **Configuration:** `.archon/config.yaml` (repo-level) and `~/.archon/config.yaml` (global). Provider/model defaults, Claude `settingSources`, Codex reasoning effort, additional directories, docs path, env-var allow-lists.

## 4. Skill / tool integration model

This is where Archon's fit with the Foundry's "cast skills" concept is closest.

- **Claude skills are first-class.** The `skills:` array on any AI node preloads Claude skill directories via SDK `AgentDefinition` wrapping. Skills live in the standard Claude location and are referenced by name. Per-node, not workflow-wide.
- **Commands** (`.archon/commands/*.md`) are reusable prompt templates with `$1`/`$2`/`$ARGUMENTS`/`$ARTIFACTS_DIR`/`$WORKFLOW_ID`/`$BASE_BRANCH`/`$DOCS_DIR`/`$LOOP_USER_INPUT`/`$REJECTION_REASON`/`$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`/`$<nodeId>.output` substitution. They are *not* code — they are prompt fragments. This maps cleanly onto a Foundry "cast skill that's just a prompt with a contract."
- **MCP servers** are configured per-node via `mcp:` (path to a config JSON, env vars expanded at execution time). Claude-only. Useful if cast skills expose themselves as MCP tools.
- **Inline `agents:`** define Claude sub-agents callable via the Task tool, scoped to the node — kebab-case IDs, optional model/tools/skills/maxTurns. This is the closest analog to dynamically composing cast skills inside a phase.
- **External executables** are reached via `bash:` or `script:` nodes. There is no "tool registry" — you call `gxwf`, `planemo`, `gh`, etc. directly. `script:` nodes with `runtime: uv` and `deps: [...]` are particularly useful: a self-contained Python script with its own dependency set runs as a node and emits structured stdout. This is the integration point for `gxwf` lint/validate/roundtrip and Planemo CLI invocations.
- **No Claude-skill-directory auto-discovery beyond what Claude Code itself does.** Archon doesn't have its own skill registry; it leans on Claude's. For non-Claude providers, `skills:` is ignored.
- **Workflow + command discovery:** automatic, three-layer precedence (bundled defaults < `~/.archon/{workflows,commands,scripts}/` global < `<repo>/.archon/...` project). Subfolder one-level nesting allowed. Validated at load time (`bun run cli validate workflows`).

## 5. Orchestration features

| Feature | Archon support |
|---|---|
| Sequencing / DAG | First-class. `nodes` with `depends_on`. Layer-parallel execution. |
| Conditional branching | `when:` expression on nodes; `cancel:` node terminates a branch. |
| Routing | The router (`packages/workflows/src/router.ts`) uses an LLM call to pick a workflow from descriptions, with a 4-tier name-resolution fallback (exact → case-insensitive → suffix → substring) and ambiguity detection. Within a workflow, branching is `when:`-based, not LLM-routed. |
| Looping / per-item iteration | `loop:` with `until:` signal, `max_iterations`, `fresh_context`, `until_bash:`, `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`. The looped unit is a single prompt — there is **no native "for each item in list, run this sub-DAG"** primitive. To loop over a list of steps, you either drive iteration from inside the prompt (the `archon-piv-loop` "Ralph pattern" reads a plan from disk and picks one task per iteration) or you author N copies of the layer. This is a real limitation for the Foundry's "loop over workflow steps" requirement. |
| Approval gates / HITL | `approval:` nodes (pure gate, optional `capture_response`, optional `on_reject` redraft). `loop: { interactive: true, gate_message }` for iterative HITL. CLI/web/platform `/workflow approve <id> <text>` and `/workflow reject <id> <reason>`. |
| Retry / failure | Per-node `retry:` with backoff (not on loop nodes — loops manage their own iteration). `trigger_rule` lets a join survive partial failures. Failures classified into structured error types (`dag.node_empty_output`, `codex_stream_incomplete`, etc.). |
| State persistence and resumption | Yes. Workflow runs persist to DB; `working_path` lets a re-run on the same branch find prior failed runs. `cli workflow resume <run-id>` re-runs, *skipping completed nodes*. Approval gates pause the run and survive process restarts. `archon-piv-loop` after-resume semantics handled explicitly (e.g., `$LOOP_USER_INPUT` only populated on first iteration after resume). |
| Observability / tracing | `workflow_events` table is a step-level event log (transitions, artifacts, errors). JSONL file logs per run under `…/logs/`. Web UI "Workflow Execution" view streams events. Pino structured logs with `{domain}.{action}_{state}` event naming. |
| Cost tracking | Per-node `maxBudgetUsd:` cap (Claude only — SDK passthrough). No global cost dashboard. |
| Concurrency | Per-DAG-layer parallelism inside a run. Multiple concurrent runs across worktrees. Same-checkout concurrency requires `mutates_checkout: false` (author asserts no race). |
| Worktree isolation | Default. `cli workflow run --branch <name>` or auto-generated name; `--no-worktree` opt-out. `archon-resolve-conflicts`, `cli isolation cleanup`, `cli complete <branch>` lifecycle. |

## 6. Knowledge base / RAG features

**There is no KB.** v1 had RAG (Supabase + pgvector + Crawl4AI); v2 dropped it entirely. The closest things v2 has:
- `$DOCS_DIR` (configurable docs path the agent can grep) — file-system docs, not a vector store.
- `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` per run, plus `<repo>/.archon/state/` for cross-run state — basically a scratchpad and a journal, not a queryable corpus.
- Codebase-scoped env vars and registered codebases.

For the Foundry's wish to host **patterns** and **IWC exemplars** in retrievable form, **Archon is the wrong shape**. You would either keep them as static files in `<repo>/.archon/state/` or `docs/` and grep from inside nodes, or pair Archon with an external retriever (MCP server, custom skill, separate vector DB). The repo's authors deliberately removed the KB layer; it is not coming back.

## 7. Extensibility and customization

- **Workflows are the extension point.** A "harness" in Foundry terms maps almost 1-to-1 onto an Archon workflow file. They are first-class, file-based, version-controlled, and discoverable. This is by far Archon's strongest fit.
- **Commands** are reusable prompt fragments — extract a phase prompt once, call it from many workflows.
- **Scripts** (`.archon/scripts/*.{ts,py}`) are reusable code units called from `script:` nodes.
- **Code-level extensibility** is narrower. New AI providers implement `IAgentProvider` (`packages/providers/src/types.ts`), new platform adapters implement `IPlatformAdapter`. There is no plugin loader for arbitrary new node types or new workflow primitives — adding (e.g.) a `for_each:` node would mean a fork of `@archon/workflows`. The repo's stated principles (KISS/YAGNI, fail-fast, no autonomous lifecycle mutation, see `CLAUDE.md`) suggest the maintainer will resist speculative extension hooks.
- **How much code vs config for a non-trivial harness?** For something like the Foundry's full pipeline — sequence, gates, routing on discover-or-author, per-step loop, gxwf/planemo/test runs, debug loop — the answer is "mostly config." You'd write one workflow YAML, ~10 commands, and 2–3 `script:` nodes for `gxwf`/`planemo`. The single sharp limitation is the per-step loop semantics (see §10).

## 8. Failure modes and limitations

- **Per-iteration "for each step" is awkward.** As noted, loops iterate a single prompt; iterating a sub-DAG over N items requires either (a) the Ralph pattern (loop reads list from disk, picks one) or (b) static unrolling. Foundry's "loop over steps: discover-or-author tool → summarize → implement → validate" cannot be expressed as a sub-DAG-per-item natively.
- **Single-developer tooling assumption.** No multi-tenancy, no auth model beyond per-adapter env-var allow-lists, no audit log targeted at compliance. Fine for a research foundry; not OK if you ever want a hosted multi-user Foundry.
- **Pre-1.0, schema churn.** CHANGELOG 0.3.10 alone shows substantive engine semantics changes (e.g., `dag.node_empty_output` failure mode, provider/model resolution rewrite, `$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`). Lock-in via YAML is small (workflows are portable), but lock-in via runtime semantics is real.
- **Provider lock-in.** The whole engine assumes one of three provider SDKs. Not a generic "any LLM" engine. Pi (community) widens this via OpenRouter-style routing but it's `builtIn: false`.
- **No native KB/retrieval** (see §6).
- **Bus factor.** Effectively one primary maintainer with a contributor pool. Pace is fast but concentrated.
- **Known recent bugs / open issues** (sample from issues 1485–1497): security CVEs in dev-chain deps (Discord adapter undici/lodash; vite/astro/postcss in dev), IME enter-key handling on web, release-workflow race conditions, GitHub App auth roadmap (#1495). Roadmap-pinned: setup overhaul to "binary-install primary + `archon doctor`" (#1494).
- **No autonomous lifecycle mutation across processes** is an explicit architectural rule (`CLAUDE.md`, citing #1216) — Archon will refuse to mark stale runs as failed. Pragmatic: requires user one-click action. Worth noting if you want "fully autonomous" harnesses.
- **Lock-in on extraction.** Workflows are plain YAML referencing prompts in plain markdown. Easy to migrate. The DB schema (8 tables) is more entangled, but artifacts on disk and per-repo `.archon/` make extraction tractable.

## 9. Roadmap and trajectory

- Cadence: weekly-ish patch releases through 0.3.x. CHANGELOG follows Keep a Changelog. SemVer.
- Recent themes (0.3.10): maintainer-workflow suite (auto PR review, daily standup, contributor-reply triage), provider/model trust-the-SDK rewrite, looped-output passthrough (`$LOOP_PREV_OUTPUT`), `mutates_checkout` for same-checkout concurrency, autodetection of Claude/Codex binary paths.
- Active roadmap items in issues: GitHub App auth (#1495), setup overhaul / `archon doctor` (#1494), security-dep churn for community adapters (#1485, #1486).
- Direction: hardening for "fire-and-forget remote agentic coding" — Slack/Telegram/GitHub triggering, multi-platform unified inbox, more automation around PR review and triage. *Not* moving toward general orchestration, KB, or multi-agent.

## 10. Concrete fit assessment for harnesses

Re-read against Foundry harness requirements:

**What Archon covers off-the-shelf:**
- **Sequencing the pipeline.** `summarize-nextflow → summary-to-galaxy-data-flow → … → run-workflow-test → debug-galaxy-workflow-output` maps directly onto a `nodes:` list with `depends_on`. Each phase is a `command:` or `prompt:` node calling a cast skill (or wrapping `gxwf`/`planemo` via `bash:` or `script:`).
- **Approval gates with full autonomy posture.** `approval:` for pure gates, `loop: { interactive: true }` for iterative HITL, plain non-interactive for fully autonomous. The same workflow file can be authored interactive or batch by toggling `interactive:` and removing approval nodes — exactly the autonomy-posture knob you described.
- **State persistence and resumption.** Run state in DB; `cli workflow resume <id>` skips completed nodes; approval pauses survive restart; per-run `$ARTIFACTS_DIR` is durable; cross-run `<repo>/.archon/state/` is durable.
- **CLI integration for `gxwf`/`planemo`.** `script:` nodes with `runtime: uv` + `deps:`, or `bash:` nodes. Stdout becomes `$node.output` for downstream nodes. `output_format:` JSON schema for Claude/Codex enforces structured outputs from validators.
- **Observability.** `workflow_events` table + Web UI step viewer + JSONL logs. Probably exceeds what a hand-rolled harness would have.
- **Concurrent runs.** Worktrees by default — useful if multiple Galaxy workflows are being foundry-cast at once.
- **Cast skill loading.** Claude skills via per-node `skills:`; reusable prompt fragments via `command:` nodes; MCP servers via `mcp:`.

**What requires non-trivial custom code on top of Archon:**
- **Per-step looping over a sub-DAG.** The "[loop over steps] discover-or-author tool → summarize tool → implement step → validate-with-gxwf → translate tests → assemble tests" sub-DAG cannot be expressed as a native for-each. Workarounds: (a) Ralph pattern in a single big `loop:` (one iteration per step, fresh context, plan-on-disk); (b) flatten by writing a shell driver that calls `bun run cli workflow run <sub-workflow>` once per step and then synthesizes — feasible but adds an outer driver; (c) fork the engine to add `for_each:` (rejected by KISS/YAGNI culture, would diverge from upstream). The Ralph pattern is what the bundled `archon-piv-loop` and `archon-ralph-dag` workflows do, and it works, but each iteration is a single prompt — sub-DAG per iteration is not native.
- **Routing within a phase** (the discover-or-author branch). Easiest expression: a `prompt:` node returning structured `output_format: { found: bool }`, then two siblings with `when:` conditions (`when: $discover.output.found == true` vs `false`), with a `cancel:` on a third branch. This works but the `when:` expression evaluator is intentionally simple; complex routing graphs become hard to read.
- **Foundry's "Mold compilation" step.** Archon doesn't compile/cast skills — it consumes them. Compilation lives outside Archon. Not a fit problem; just confirming the boundary.
- **Pattern/IWC-exemplar retrieval.** Either keep them on the filesystem and grep from inside nodes, or pair with an external retriever. Not Archon's job.

**What Archon would actively get in the way of:** very little. The main friction is if you want a different runtime model (durable async like Temporal, externally-scheduled, or a different agent runtime than Claude/Codex/Pi). Archon assumes one in-process Bun event loop, one of three SDKs.

**Lightweight harness end of the spectrum** (simple sequence of cast skills): **Archon is overkill.** A 10-line shell script or a small Python file calling the Anthropic SDK does this and incurs no DB, no daemon, no platform-adapter layer, no schema. *But:* if you're going to write more than two harnesses, the marginal cost of the second Archon workflow is much lower than the second hand-rolled harness, because you already have observability, resumption, and a UI. Verdict: lightweight harnesses *alone* don't justify Archon; lightweight + heavy mixed does.

**Heavy harness end** (gated, resumable, multi-step, observability-equipped): **Archon is genuinely close to enough**, with the per-step-loop caveat. Concretely it covers ~80% of the heavy-harness requirements, and the missing 20% (per-item sub-DAGs, complex routing) is workable via Ralph + `when:` patterns. You would *not* need to compose Archon with LangGraph or Temporal for the Foundry's stated requirements. You might compose it with a small external retriever for patterns/IWC exemplars.

**Concrete recommendation.** **Hybrid — lean on Archon as the harness substrate, but isolate the boundary.** Author Foundry harnesses as Archon workflows under `<repo>/.archon/workflows/`, cast skills as Claude skills + `.archon/commands/`, and call `gxwf`/`planemo` via `script:` and `bash:` nodes. Keep the Mold-compilation step entirely outside Archon. Keep IWC/pattern retrieval outside Archon (filesystem or MCP). Do **not** build deep dependencies on Archon's DB schema or its TypeScript engine APIs — treat workflows-as-YAML as the only durable contract; that's where extraction cost is low. Accept the per-step-loop limitation up front and design the per-step pipeline around the Ralph pattern (single big loop reading the step list from disk). Revisit in 3–6 months: if Archon hits 1.0 with the loop-over-list primitive added, double down; if v2 churn continues, the YAML + commands are still portable to a hand-rolled runner.

## 11. Alternatives worth comparing

- **LangGraph (Python).** Graph-based agent orchestration with explicit state, conditional edges, checkpointing, and a strong "for each / branch / merge" vocabulary. Better than Archon at expressing per-step sub-DAGs and complex routing; weaker at being a *product* (no UI, no platform adapters, no built-in worktree/PR lifecycle). If the Foundry's hardest problem is the per-step branching graph, LangGraph is a better orchestration kernel; but you would build all the Archon-shaped scaffolding (run DB, resumption, gates UI, multi-platform invocation) yourself.
- **Temporal / Inngest.** Durable workflow orchestrators with rock-solid state, retries, and resumption — far stronger than Archon on those axes — but at the cost of being infrastructure, not a coding-agent product. Activities are arbitrary code; they have no concept of LLM nodes, approvals, skills, MCP, or worktrees. You'd be building the agent layer on top. Use only if "this must survive any restart, forever" is a hard requirement; for a research foundry it isn't.
- **CrewAI / AutoGen.** Multi-agent frameworks where "agents" with roles negotiate. Wrong shape for the Foundry's deterministic-pipeline goal — you don't want agents deciding the order, you want the harness deciding. Both are also weaker on resumption and gates than Archon.
- **Plain Python with the Anthropic SDK** (the do-nothing-fancy baseline). Honest answer: for a single harness end-to-end, this is *fine*. You write one script per harness, you ship cast skills as files, you `subprocess.run("gxwf …")`. You lose: parallel reviewer fan-out, structured observability, the Web UI step viewer, resume-from-failure, multi-platform invocation. You gain: zero dependencies on a pre-1.0 engine, full control. Use this for the lightweight-harness end *if you don't already need Archon for the heavy end*. If you need Archon at all, use it for both.
- **Claude Code itself, with skills only.** A Claude skill *is* a small harness when its instructions and supporting scripts are well-shaped. For very simple sequencing (one phase calls another via the SlashCommand or Task tool), no orchestrator is needed. The Foundry's "lightweight harness" end may genuinely be expressible as a single Claude skill that calls cast skills sequentially. Worth piloting before adopting Archon.

## Recommendation

Adopt Archon as the substrate for **heavy** Foundry harnesses, treating workflow YAML and commands as the only durable contract. It gives you ~80% of the heavy-harness requirements off-the-shelf — sequencing, approval gates, retries, resumption, observability, parallel fan-out, worktree isolation, Claude-skill loading, MCP, structured outputs, and a usable Web UI — with the noteworthy limitation that "loop over a list of items, each running a sub-DAG" is not a native primitive (use the bundled Ralph pattern). Do not let it host pattern/IWC-exemplar retrieval; that's the wrong shape and v2 deliberately removed the KB. For **lightweight** harnesses (simple sequence of cast skills) Archon is overkill in isolation but cheap once you're already running it for the heavy end.

**Next steps (prioritized):**
1. Build a throwaway proof-of-concept harness in Archon that exercises (a) a `script: { runtime: uv }` node calling `gxwf validate`, (b) a Ralph-pattern loop over a fake step list, (c) one `approval:` gate, (d) a `cancel:` branch from a `when:` route. Goal: confirm the per-step-loop ergonomics are tolerable for the real pipeline.
2. Decide where Mold compilation lives (outside Archon) and where pattern/IWC retrieval lives (outside Archon — pick filesystem grep vs. MCP server). Document the boundary so the Foundry doesn't drift Archon into KB territory.
3. Pin to a specific Archon release in the Foundry's docs and re-evaluate at each minor bump until 1.0; v2 semantics are still moving (CHANGELOG 0.3.10 alone changed provider/model resolution).
4. If the proof-of-concept exposes that per-step sub-DAGs are too painful: prototype the same flow in LangGraph as a head-to-head comparison before committing.
5. Skip CrewAI/AutoGen/Temporal/Inngest for now — wrong shape or too heavy for a research foundry.
