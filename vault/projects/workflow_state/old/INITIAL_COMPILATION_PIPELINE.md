# Initial Compilation Pipeline

Initial sketch of how Molds become cast skills. Anchored to the file layout in `INITIAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` (`molds/<name>/` → `casts/<target>/<name>/`). Working premise: **LLM-driven, evolution-friendly, reproducible enough to diff**. Casting is not deterministic; it is recorded.

## What casting is

Casting takes a Mold (a typed reference manifest plus a procedural body) and its declared references — pattern pages, CLI manual pages, IO schemas, prompt fragments, examples — and produces a target-specific skill artifact. The cast is **condensed and isolated** — no links back to the Foundry, no runtime dependency on it.

Casting operates as **per-kind dispatch** over the manifest, not a single resolve-and-inline pass. Different reference kinds get different transformations:

| Reference kind | Source location | Casting transformation | Lands at |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | `content/patterns/*.md` | LLM-condensed, mixed verbatim + summarization | inlined into `SKILL.md` (or `references/patterns/` for large pages) |
| `cli-command` | `content/cli/<tool>/<cmd>.md` | Cast to structured JSON sidecar | `references/cli/<tool>/<cmd>.json` |
| `schema` | `schemas/*.schema.json` | Verbatim copy | `references/schemas/<name>.schema.json` |
| `prompt` | `content/prompts/*.md` | Inlined verbatim, no LLM rewrite | inlined into `SKILL.md` or `references/prompts/` |
| `example` | `content/molds/<slug>/examples/`, shared `content/examples/` | Verbatim copy | `references/examples/` |
| `eval` | `content/molds/<slug>/eval.md` | **Never packaged** | — (Foundry-only) |
| `mold` (smell) | another Mold | Discouraged; see Open questions | — |

Verbatim-copy paths are deterministic; LLM-driven condensation is reserved for kinds where it adds value (patterns, partial manpage extracts when only a slice is referenced).

The casting process is itself expected to evolve. Today: an LLM with a target-specific prompt for the condensation steps; deterministic file copies for the rest. Tomorrow: maybe smarter prompts, different models per kind, partial determinism within a kind. The Foundry does not lock in a casting algorithm; it locks in a **contract** (input shape, output shape, provenance).

## When casting runs

Three triggers, in increasing automation:

1. **Manual.** `foundry cast <mold-name> --target=<target>`. The default for v1. A maintainer runs this when a Mold has changed and they want to see the new cast.
2. **CI on Mold change.** When a PR touches `molds/<name>/`, CI re-casts that Mold against all configured targets and surfaces the diff in review.
3. **Watch-on-change** (dev convenience). `foundry cast --watch` re-casts on file change for tight iteration.

`foundry status` reports drift: which casts in `casts/<target>/<name>/` were produced from a different Mold content hash than what's currently on disk.

## Input contract

To cast a Mold, the casting process consumes:

- **The Mold directory** — `index.md` (frontmatter manifest + procedural body) plus, if the schema permits, casting hints. **Not** `eval.md` — evals stay in the Foundry.
- **All typed references declared in the manifest**, resolved by kind:
  - `patterns` — wiki links into `content/patterns/`.
  - `cli_commands` — wiki links into `content/cli/<tool>/<cmd>.md`.
  - `input_schemas` / `output_schemas` — paths into `schemas/`.
  - `prompts` — wiki links into `content/prompts/` (when the Mold needs them).
  - `examples` — paths into `content/molds/<slug>/examples/` or shared `content/examples/`.
  - IWC exemplar URLs cited in pattern bodies are resolved by the pattern transformation, not by the casting top-level (URLs stay URLs in pattern bodies; pinning to a SHA is at the pattern author's discretion).
  - Other Molds (`related_molds`) — flagged as a smell; see Open questions.
- **The cast target spec** — a per-target adapter (prompt templates per kind + output structure) declared in `casts/<target>/_target.yml`.
- **A casting model and prompt version** — recorded in provenance.

Resolution policy is per-kind, not a single rule:
- `pattern` — verbatim inline if under a size threshold; LLM-summarize otherwise. Casting hints (`inline: true` / `summarize: true`) may override.
- `cli-command` — always cast to JSON sidecar (deterministic structuring; no token-budget condensation needed because the sidecar is loaded only when the agent needs that command).
- `schema`, `example`, `prompt` — always verbatim copy. No LLM in the loop.
- `eval` — never packaged.

## Output contract

Per cast: `casts/<target>/<mold-name>/`. Layout depends on target.

For the **Claude target**:
```
casts/claude/<mold-name>/
├── SKILL.md                  # the skill body Claude loads
├── references/               # supporting content, organized by kind
│   ├── schemas/              # verbatim *.schema.json
│   ├── cli/                  # JSON sidecars cast from manpages
│   │   └── <tool>/<cmd>.json
│   ├── patterns/             # condensed pattern excerpts (when not fully inlined)
│   ├── prompts/              # verbatim prompt fragments (when not fully inlined)
│   └── examples/             # verbatim fixtures
└── _provenance.json          # required, not part of the skill
```

Per-kind subdirectories under `references/` mirror the casting dispatch and let the cast skill's runtime locate any artifact deterministically.

For the **web target** (sketch):
```
casts/web/<mold-name>/
├── skill.json                # structured skill description
├── prompt.md
└── _provenance.json
```

For **generic**: shape TBD; probably a single self-contained markdown.

`_provenance.json` is required for every cast and contains:

```json
{
  "mold_name": "implement-galaxy-tool-step",
  "mold_content_hash": "<sha256 of mold.md>",
  "mold_commit": "<git SHA at cast time>",
  "casting_model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "casting_prompt_version": "v3",
  "casting_target": "claude",
  "cast_at": "2026-04-29T20:15:00Z",
  "resolved_refs": [
    { "kind": "pattern",     "name": "galaxy-collection-manipulation", "hash": "<sha256>" },
    { "kind": "cli-command", "name": "gxwf/tool-search",                "hash": "<sha256>" },
    { "kind": "cli-command", "name": "gxwf/tool-versions",              "hash": "<sha256>" },
    { "kind": "schema",      "name": "summary-paper.schema.json",       "hash": "<sha256>" },
    { "kind": "example",     "name": "scatter-with-collection.gxformat2.yml", "hash": "<sha256>" }
  ]
}
```

Provenance is the foundation for drift detection, reproducibility audits, and "why does this cast contain X" forensics.

## Process steps (per cast)

```
cast_mold(mold_name, target):
  mold     <- read molds/<mold_name>/index.md
  validate mold against frontmatter schema (incl. typed-reference manifest)
  refs     <- resolve_manifest(mold)               # by kind: patterns, cli_commands, schemas, prompts, examples
  validate every ref exists and conforms to its kind's contract
  target   <- load_target_adapter(target)

  # Per-kind dispatch:
  for ref in refs:
    case ref.kind:
      pattern      -> condensed = llm.condense(ref, target.pattern_prompt)
                      stash for SKILL.md inlining or write to references/patterns/
      cli-command  -> sidecar = llm.cast_manpage_to_json(ref, target.cli_prompt)
                      write to references/cli/<tool>/<cmd>.json
      schema       -> copy verbatim to references/schemas/
      prompt       -> copy verbatim (inlined or to references/prompts/)
      example      -> copy verbatim to references/examples/
      eval         -> skip

  skill_md  <- target.assemble_skill(mold.body, condensed_patterns, manifest)
  write SKILL.md to casts/<target>/<mold_name>/
  write _provenance.json (mold hash, model(s), prompt version(s), per-ref hashes, timestamp)
```

The LLM is invoked per kind that needs condensation, not once globally. Streaming, retries, and per-kind output validation (does the JSON sidecar parse? does the condensed pattern preserve required sections?) live in the per-kind handler. If any handler fails, the cast aborts and the previous cast on disk is unchanged.

## Drift detection

A cast is **stale** when any of:
- The Mold's `mold.md` content hash differs from `_provenance.mold_content_hash`.
- Any resolved ref's content hash differs from the recorded `resolved_refs[*].hash`.
- The target adapter (prompt version) has changed.
- The casting model has changed (and we want to re-cast against the new model).

`foundry status` enumerates stale casts; `foundry cast --all` re-casts every stale entry. Re-casting against an unchanged Mold and unchanged refs with the same model produces a different artifact because the LLM is non-deterministic — that's expected and reviewed via diff.

## Versioning

**No semver on Molds, no semver on casts.** Identity is content hash + commit SHA. Re-casting is the migration path. If a cast skill needs to be "frozen" (e.g., a published skill on a marketplace), pin it by commit SHA in the consumer.

This keeps the Foundry's iteration loop fast: change a Mold, re-cast, review the diff. Don't bump versions, don't manage compatibility tables, don't write changelogs for every cast.

## Reproducibility

Casting is **non-deterministic** (LLM). What we guarantee instead is **traceability**: every cast records exactly what went into it (Mold hash, ref hashes, model, prompt version). A reviewer can:

- Check whether a cast is up-to-date (drift detection).
- Reproduce the *inputs* to a cast (clone the repo at the recorded commit SHA, re-cast).
- Compare two casts' provenance to explain content differences.

We do not guarantee that re-casting produces byte-identical output. We do guarantee that re-casting produces output derivable from the same inputs.

## What casting does *not* do

- **Does not write to the Foundry.** Casting is read-only against `content/molds/`, `content/patterns/`, `content/cli/`, `content/prompts/`, `content/examples/`, and `schemas/`. All writes go to `casts/`.
- **Does not invoke gxwf or Planemo.** Those are the cast skill's responsibility at runtime, not casting time. (Validation tooling does invoke schemas, but that's distinct.)
- **Does not update Molds.** If casting reveals a Mold is wrong, that's a hand edit by the maintainer.
- **Does not touch eval plans.** `eval.md` is Foundry-only; never read by casting.

## v1 minimum

To exercise the architecture without overbuilding:

- One cast target: **Claude**. Web and generic deferred.
- One casting model: pick one, pin in `casts/claude/_target.yml`.
- Cast 3-4 Molds end-to-end: `summarize-paper` (exercises `schema` + `pattern`), `implement-galaxy-tool-step` (exercises `pattern` + `example`), `validate-with-gxwf` (exercises `cli-command` reference from a per-action Mold), `gxwf-cli` (exercises whole-CLI roll-up + many `cli-command` references). Diversity exercises the per-kind dispatch, not just the prompt.
- Manual `foundry cast` only — no CI, no watch.
- Commit casts to the repo so we can review the actual outputs.

If those casts look reasonable and the provenance flow holds, scale to more Molds and more targets.

## Open questions

- **Casting prompt granularity.** Per-kind prompts are baseline (pattern-condense vs. manpage-to-JSON vs. skill-assembly are different jobs). Open: do action Molds vs. analytical Molds want different *skill-assembly* prompts? v1: one skill-assembly prompt per target; refactor when one prompt no longer fits.
- **Recursive casting depth.** If Mold A wiki-links Mold B (`related_molds`), do we resolve B's content into A's cast, or just summarize that B exists? v1: surface as a smell, allow but warn. The intended escape valve for "two Molds need shared content" is to factor that content into a **pattern page, CLI manual page, prompt fragment, or schema** — kinds that already have casting transformations — not a Mold-to-Mold link. Revisit if a legitimate Mold-to-Mold need surfaces.
- **Caching ref resolution.** Re-resolving every wiki link every cast is wasteful at scale. v1: no cache. Add when casting count makes it noticeable.
- **Cast diff hygiene.** LLM output is noisy; casts will produce churny diffs even on small Mold edits. Consider an output-stabilization pass (deterministic re-formatting). Defer until churn becomes painful.
- **Multi-target casts in one run.** `foundry cast <mold-name>` (no `--target`) — cast to all configured targets in parallel? v1: explicit `--target` required.
